Stress test the fuck out of the server

	*Try to overload with requests -> did some basic stuff but not a siege program or something
	*Check for memory management / proper error handling -> did basic valgrind checks

Issues:

If file fails to upload it still shows up with 0kb size

Think about whether we want to kill the CGI after a while
