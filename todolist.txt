Stress test the fuck out of the server

	*Try to overload with requests -> did some basic stuff but not a siege program or something
	*Check for memory management / proper error handling -> did basic valgrind checks

Implement redirections
Limit amount of clients (&& servers in config)

Issues:

:8081 breaks server (because root folder doesn't exist?)
erase duplicate ipaddress servers after parsing

â—¦ Make it work with POST and GET methods. <- wtf? More research required
