Have a website to demo webserv

	*delete files -> fix message if delete unsuccesful

Stress test the fuck out of the server

	*Try to overload with requests -> did some basic stuff but not a siege program or something
	*Check for memory management / proper error handling -> did basic valgrind checks

Implement redirections

Issues:

Clicking a bunch will sometimes cause something to get stuck half-loaded
:8081 breaks server (because root folder doesn't exist?)
